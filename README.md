# @darrellvs/node-steam-deck-sdk

An unofficial SDK for Elgato's Stream Deck / Stream Deck + devices

## IMPORTANT

> This package relies on the **WebSocket Proxy** plugin for Stream Deck. Which you can find [here](https://marketplace.elgato.com/product/websocket-proxy-5ed6a37a-d6e9-4c95-aa95-42ded37ecff1).\
> Special thanks to [Yann Bizeul](https://github.com/ybizeul) for his excellent work on this plugin!\
> This package is not affiliated with Elgato or Yann Bizeul.

## Introduction

This package provides you with utilities to interact with Elgato's Stream Deck devices.\
It allows you to listen for changes on the device and send commands to the device.

## Installation

Install @darrellvs/node-steam-deck-sdk with npm

```bash
  npm install @darrellvs/node-steam-deck-sdk
```

or yarn

```bash
  yarn add @darrellvs/node-steam-deck-sdk
```

or (if you dare) pnpm

```bash
  pnpm add @darrellvs/node-steam-deck-sdk
```

## Features

- **Bi-directional communication**\
  Listen for changes and send commands to the Stream Deck plugin.

- **Multiple device types supported**\
  This SDK supports both the Stream Deck and Stream Deck + devices.

- **TypeScript support**\
  This package is written in TypeScript and provides type definitions.

- **Easy to use**\
  The SDK is designed to be easy to use and understand.

- **Provided examples**\
  Examples are provided to help you get started.

#### All communication is bi-directional, and thus allows you to listen for changes:

```typescript
// Log when and how much the dial with id dial_1 is rotated
streamDeck.onDialRotate('dial_1', (ticks) => {
  console.log(`Dial 1 rotated ${ticks} ticks`);
});

// Or more advanced, log when the LCD for dial 1 is held, and log the position of the tap
streamDeck.onLcdHold('dial_1', ({ tapPosition }) => {
  console.log(
    `LCD of dial 1 held at position x:${tapPosition.x} y:${tapPosition.y}`
  );
});
```

## Available events

The following events are available, with their respective parameters:

<details>
<summary><code>onDialRotate(dial_id, (ticks, params) => void): void</code></summary>
<br>

```typescript
// The amount of ticks the dial was rotated
ticks: number;

### Additionally, you may listen to events emitted by the Stream Deck plugin:

<details>
<summary><code>pluginConnected</code></summary>

This event is emitted when the Stream Deck plugin connects to the WebSocket server.

#### Example usage

```typescript
streamDeck.on('pluginConnected', () => {
  console.log(`Stream Deck plugin connected`);
});
```

</details>

<br>

<details>
<summary><code>willAppear</code></summary>

This event is emitted when a button or dial / lcd is about to appear on the Stream Deck.\
Use this if you need to process some data, set an initial state (value, indicator, layout, image, etc.) before the plugin appears.

#### Example usage

```typescript
streamDeck.on('willAppear', (id, params) => {
  console.log(`Element with id ${id} will appear`);
  console.log(`Parameters:`, params);
});
```

</details>

<br>

<details>
<summary><code>willDisappear</code></summary>

This event is emitted when a button or dial / lcd is about to disappear from the Stream Deck.\
Use this if you need to clean up, reset, or save some data before the plugin disappears.

#### Example usage

```typescript
streamDeck.on('willDisappear', (id, params) => {
  console.log(`Element with id ${id} will disappear`);
  console.log(`Parameters:`, params);
});
```

</details>

## Notes

#### I will not be actively updating this library

As long as Elgato doesn't break anything.\
Minor issues may be patched, major issues may or may not 👀
